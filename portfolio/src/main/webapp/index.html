      <p>Hi, my name is Kenneth Addo. I was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland and have lived here for most of my life. I am currently rising junior at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) studying computer engineering with a minor in math. </p>

      <p>My interests include software engineering, human-computer interaction, and software/hardware efficiency. My hobbies are watching anime, playing games, playing ping pong and doing taekwondo. The latter two I picked up from my freshman year in college, but I've been watching anime for over a decade now. </p>
